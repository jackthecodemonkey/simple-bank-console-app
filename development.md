* Working on File IO
    0. Fix a bug: account number should be unique when adding
    1. Implement load data from CSV and create Account struct -> return Accounts models : DONE
    2. Implement AddAccount, pass account as a param, make it comma separated sting then write(amend) to file  
* Add a mechanism to switch between file and db context ( factory pattern? )
